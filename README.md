The task was to calculate the triangle coordinates for an image with right triangles such that for a given row (A-F) and column (1-12) you can produce the layout: 60 x 60 Pixels. Each non-hypotenuse side of the triangle is 10 pixels. Lastly, given the vertex coordinates, to calculate the row and column for the triangle.

Sample output:
A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 A10 A11 A12
B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12
C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9 C10 C11 C12
D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8 D9 D10 D11 D12
E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 E8 E9 E10 E11 E12
F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 F10 F11 F12

Retriving location of triangle: tri.pT.X = 30, tri.pT.Y = 0, tri.pC.X = 30, tri.pC.Y = 10, tri.pB.X = 40, tri.pB.Y = 10.

The triangle is located at: A7
